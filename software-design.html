<h2>CS255 DriverPass System</h2>

<p>
This artifact shows the DriverPass system’s business requirements and system design. It was originally created to meet needs for scheduling, user roles, and reporting. Through enhancement, I strengthened role-based access control, clarified component boundaries, and added security responsibilities to the design. These improvements demonstrate skills in architectural evaluation, secure system design, and professional documentation.

<h1>Professional Self-Assessment</h1>

<p>
Completing the Computer Science program and developing this ePortfolio has allowed me to transform from a student completing assignments into a computing professional capable of designing, evaluating, and securing real systems. Throughout the program, I developed technical depth in software design, algorithms, and databases while also refining my ability to communicate technical concepts clearly to diverse audiences. The capstone experience required me not only to enhance previous artifacts but also to critically evaluate my own work, identify weaknesses, and implement improvements that align with industry standards. This process strengthened both my technical skill set and my professional identity.
</p>

<p>
One of the most significant areas of growth during the program has been collaboration and communication. Through code reviews, structured design documents, and narrative reflections, I learned how to explain technical decisions in a way that supports stakeholder understanding and organizational decision making. The informal code review required me to present existing functionality, analyze weaknesses, and justify planned enhancements as if speaking to peers or management. This experience mirrors real-world development environments where engineers must communicate trade-offs, justify architectural decisions, and collaborate effectively within teams.
</p>

<p>
In the area of software design and engineering, my work on the DriverPass system demonstrates growth in architectural thinking and security awareness. Originally, the system design focused on functionality such as scheduling lessons and tracking student progress. Through enhancement, I strengthened role-based access considerations, clarified system boundaries, and emphasized security responsibilities within the design. This demonstrates my ability to evaluate software architecture not only for functionality but also for maintainability, scalability, and risk mitigation. These are essential competencies in modern IT environments where system reliability and compliance are critical.
</p>

<p>
My enhancement in algorithms and data structures through the CS300 course planner artifact demonstrates my ability to evaluate trade-offs in data structure selection and runtime performance. By comparing vector-based storage, hash tables, and binary search trees, I gained practical insight into time complexity, efficiency, and scalability. I learned to justify design decisions based on performance characteristics rather than convenience. This directly aligns with the program outcome of designing computing solutions using algorithmic principles while managing trade-offs. The process reinforced the importance of selecting appropriate data structures to ensure optimal performance and long-term maintainability.
</p>

<p>
In the databases category, the Travlr Getaways full-stack application allowed me to demonstrate database integration, validation, and secure data handling. Through enhancements, I strengthened schema constraints, implemented consistent server-side validation and sanitization, improved error handling, and ensured secure database interactions. These improvements reflect a proactive security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits and mitigates vulnerabilities at the architectural level. Understanding how improper validation or weak schema enforcement can compromise data integrity has significantly influenced how I approach system design.
</p>

<p>
Security has become a consistent theme throughout my development as a computer science professional. Rather than viewing security as an afterthought, I now approach system architecture with the assumption that inputs may be malicious and that access must be controlled explicitly. Across all three artifact categories, I incorporated stronger validation, clearer access control, and improved structural integrity. This demonstrates my ability to identify design flaws and mitigate potential vulnerabilities, aligning with industry best practices and the program’s emphasis on secure computing.
</p>

<p>
Collectively, the artifacts in this portfolio demonstrate my ability to integrate multiple domains of computer science. Software design, algorithms, and databases do not exist independently; they operate together within complete systems. The DriverPass artifact emphasizes architectural planning and stakeholder communication. The CS300 artifact highlights algorithmic reasoning and efficiency trade-offs. The Travlr Getaways application demonstrates full-stack integration and secure data management. Together, these artifacts illustrate my ability to design, evaluate, and enhance computing solutions holistically.
</p>

<p>
As I move forward professionally with the goal of becoming an IT Service Management administrator, the competencies developed in this program directly support that path. ITSM environments require strong understanding of system architecture, database reliability, secure authentication, performance optimization, and stakeholder communication. The analytical thinking and structured enhancement process demonstrated in this ePortfolio reflect the skills required to manage complex IT systems responsibly and effectively.
</p>

<p>
This capstone represents not only the completion of academic requirements but also the culmination of technical growth, professional communication development, and the establishment of a security-focused mindset. The artifacts that follow provide tangible evidence of this growth and demonstrate my readiness to contribute meaningfully within the field of computer science.
